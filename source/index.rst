Creating a Bot with Discord.py Rewrite
######################################

This document covers setting up a Discord bot using the Discord.py Rewrite.

###############
Getting Started
###############

It is important to understand that there are currently two versions of Discord.py:

* **Discord.py**

    I don't know much about this version, aside that it not compatible with Python 3.4.2+

* **Discord.py Rewrite**

    This version is compatible with Python 3.4.2+, however it is currently not
    compatible with Python 3.7+.

    My bots have been built using Python 3.6.6.
